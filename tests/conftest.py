"""
tests/conftest.py

Shared test helpers for logging a Flask test client in as a real,
DB-backed user. Routes are gated with @login_required (see ez_kea/auth.py),
so route-level tests need a session that flask_login recognizes as
authenticated. We create a real User row and stash its id directly in the
test client's session the same way flask_login's login_user() does,
bypassing the password/2FA flow itself, which these route-level tests
aren't concerned with.

# Keep create_app() from starting the log-index background thread during tests.
# Config reads this at import time and several fixtures set TESTING only *after*
# create_app() returns, too late for the guard inside start_background_indexer.
# Left to its default, every app a test builds would spawn a thread writing to
# the developer's real ./data directory on a timer. The index itself is tested
# directly in test_log_index.py.
